# Canoga-CPP
Canoga is a two-player dice game. This is a variant of the popular Shut The Box game.

This is my first project for a class I'm taking called Organization Of Programming Languages. The game
will be implemented in 4 different languages to discover different diagrams of computer programing and
design: C++, Lisp, Java/Android, and Prolog.

The start date of the development of this project: 9/4/15
The due-date for the completion of this project: 9/25/15
