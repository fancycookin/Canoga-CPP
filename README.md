# Canoga-CPP
Canoga is a two-player dice game. This is a variant of the popular Shut The Box game.

This is my first project for a class I'm taking called Organization Of Programming Languages. The game
will be implemented in 4 different languages to discover different diagrams of computer programing and
design: C++, Lisp, Java/Android, and Prolog.

The start date of the development of this project: 9/4/15
The due-date for the completion of this project: 9/25/15

Maybe a little behind? I spent all yesterday watching Rick & Morty... priorities. So no coding
done.
Today, my car broke down and had to spend the entire day trying to fix it. I had about 30 minutes free
to do some coding today, so I laid down the base strucutre of the design for the game. It is now late
in the evening and it is a Saturday night, so ... family time!

untill tomorrow!

Tonight is the first submission checkpoint of this project. I have to submit my current progress, log
files, and source code to the instructor of the course.

I have made a lot of local changes that I have yet to submit to GitHub. However, I am in the process of reworking some issues with the Game class and reconstructing the Board class.

Additional commits will be made during the weekend!
